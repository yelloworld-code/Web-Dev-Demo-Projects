# Photo Search App

A React application that allows users to search for high-quality photos using the Unsplash API. Features a responsive masonry grid layout for displaying search results.

## Features

- **Photo Search**: Search for photos using keywords through the Unsplash API
- **Masonry Grid Layout**: Responsive grid that adjusts image heights dynamically
- **Semantic UI Styling**: Clean, modern interface using Semantic UI components
- **Real-time Search**: Instant search results as you submit queries

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework with class components
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API requests
- **Unsplash API**: Photo database and search functionality
- **Semantic UI**: CSS framework for styling
- **CSS Grid**: Modern layout system for masonry effect

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Unsplash API key (get one from [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd photo-search-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Unsplash API key:

   ```
   REACT_APP_unsplashID=your_unsplash_access_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

```

## How It Works

1. **Search**: Users enter search terms in the search bar
2. **API Call**: App makes a request to Unsplash API with the search query
3. **Display**: Results are displayed in a responsive masonry grid
4. **Dynamic Sizing**: Images are sized based on their aspect ratios for optimal layout

## API Configuration

The app uses the Unsplash API for photo search. You'll need to:

1. Sign up for a free Unsplash developer account
2. Get your access key
3. Add it to your `.env` file as `REACT_APP_unsplashID`

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App (irreversible)

## Features in Detail

### Masonry Layout

The app uses CSS Grid with dynamic row spans to create a Pinterest-style masonry layout. Each image calculates its required grid rows based on its height, ensuring a visually balanced display.

### Responsive Design

The grid automatically adjusts to different screen sizes using `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr))`, making it work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Semantic UI Integration

The search bar uses Semantic UI form components for a polished, accessible interface.
