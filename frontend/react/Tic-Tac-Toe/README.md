# Tic-Tac-Toe

- **Draw detection** when all squares are filled and no winner is found
- **Editable player names** with instant UI updates
- **Reset / rematch** button to start a new game
- **Move log** shows selected square coordinates for each turn
- **Button disabling** prevents overwriting occupied squares
