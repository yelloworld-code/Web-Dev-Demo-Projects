# This line creates all the tables defined in your SQLAlchemy models in the database. 
# The create_all method is called on the metadata of the Base class, which is the base class for all your models. 
# The bind parameter specifies the database engine to use for creating the tables. 
# In this case, it uses the engine that was created in the database.py file, which is connected to the SQLite database specified in the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL variable.
